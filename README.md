# Mask-Detector

A model to detect face masks in real-time video streams and calculates the number of persons without masks in the video stream.
I used haar cascade in open cv to detect and extract faces.
Then I have done data augmentation to these faces and built a model with transfer learning where I used Mobilenet which is a CNN architecture because it has very less computation power to run.
